tasks: 
wire in the irq handler  (done)
write the irq handler: 
	- determine if timer interrupt has occurred 
	- act on positive timer interrupt: 
		-> initializes the sp_irq to point to 0xa1500000
		<sub out to C_irq handler> 
		-> loads the match registers without drift
			stores OSMR0 with correct timer value
		->
	- ignore all other timer interrupts



Tasks that must be done in some part of code: 
-> masks all other types of interrupts
