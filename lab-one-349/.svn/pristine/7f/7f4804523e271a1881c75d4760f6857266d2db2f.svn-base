	@ Needs more code.
	@ Added some code below
	

	SWI WRITE_SWI	@ no change in params (r0-r2)
	TST r0, #-1 	@ check for negative result (meaning error)
	BPL done
	NEG r0, r0	@ sysCall error, set errno 
	str r0, [errorNum, #0]
  	mov r0, #-1	@ set wrapper to return -1
			

done: 	@ only valid to test errno when syscall wrapper returns -1
	MOV pc, lr


errorNum: .word errno
