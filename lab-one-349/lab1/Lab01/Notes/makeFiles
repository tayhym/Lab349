What does typing make do?
Program looks for file named makeFile and executes it. 

How to ask make to look for a different makeFile? 
make -f myMakeFile

What is the build process that the compiler and linker do 
in the makeFile? 
Compiler takes source files and outputs assembly files that
assembler converts to object files. Linker takes object files
and creates executable. This executable is taken by loader 
and loaded into memory. 

How is this related to the usual way of doing things? 
Exactly the same, usual way is gcc file1.c file.c file2.c -o file
